# Steamworks DLL Cheats
A set of Steamworks Cheats in DLL format for when you're bored playing the game!

## Disclaimer:

THESE CHEATS ARE MADE FOR EDUCATIONAL PURPOSE ONLY AND WERE MADE TO LEARN DOTNET DECOMPILATION.

## List of cheats

* Every Achievements Unlocker
* (nothing else...)


I know you expected more cheats but I just started this project, so feel free to help me out here!


# How to install

* Step 1: Take the .dll of the cheat you want (example: UnlockAllAchievements.dll)
* Step 2: Copy the file and go to Steamworks's game files (usually C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Smithworks)
* Step 3: Open Smithworks_Data and find the Managed folder.
* Step 4: Find the "Assembly-CSharp.dll" file and rename it to something you'll remember for the original game code.
* Step 5: Paste your cheat of choice and rename it to "Assembly-CSharp.dll".
* Step 6: Open the game and enjoy!

Remember: Some cheats work as a one-time only, like UnlockAllAchievements, and once ran and executed you can swap back the original game code (Assembly-CSharp.dll)
